# Davide Gualano
Welcome to my personal portfolio! I’m a Ma in Cultural Anthropology and Ethnology at Università degli Studi di Torino with a passion for Football – or Soccer if you prefer – data analysis.

## About Me
I have experience in data analysis with Python that I showcase in my [newsletter](https://the-cutback.beehiiv.com/), and brought me to have a freelancer experience at DAZN Italy as data editor.
