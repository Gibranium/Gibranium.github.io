# Davide Gualano
Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm a Master's in Cultural Anthropology and Ethnology from UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Torino with a passion for Football â€“ or Soccer if you prefer â€“ data analysis.

## About Me
I have experience in data analysis with Python that I showcase in my [newsletter](https://the-cutback.beehiiv.com/).

## Skills
- Python for data analysis
- Football/Soccer analytics
- Strong research methodology from academic training (BA in History, MA in Cultural Anthropology)
