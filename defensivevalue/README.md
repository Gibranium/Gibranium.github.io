# Defensive Value
This is my version of the defensive value metric, as written by Ian Graham in _How to Win The Premier League_, this metric was used to evaluate defensive ability before the adoption of tracking data.
I've detailed my thought process behind its calculation [here](https://the-cutback.beehiiv.com/p/defensive-quality-convex-hull-approach-refined) for the first time. Later, after refining and improving the model, I revisited it in this follow-up [piece](https://the-cutback.beehiiv.com/p/juventus-defense-danilo-metrics-analysis-serie-a-vaep-padj).
