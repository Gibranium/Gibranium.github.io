# Team Style Similarity Project
This was a project I built with the intent of creating ratings for team similarity to apply them in recruitment, but also to create a simple way to explore team style themselves with a widget in the notebook. To do this I leveraged on possession chain based features as a starting point for game state contextual metrics and not simple events as take ons, first third passes and so on.
